# What is cute?

Aesthetic judgements is done through factors that create perception.
Therefore Aesthetic registers is how the perception of something is categorised. For instance, culturem genre and subjective affects (emotions).
The opposite of cute could be zany, chaotic or uncanny. 

I found tha aesthetic registers are percieved criteras that aim to distingish perceieved experiences.

## So..... what is cute???

- Approachable
- Non threateniong
- Creates excitemennt - playful
- Sounds fluid, or higher pitches
- Vulnerable

Cute can be powerful. And influence through ideas such as soft power.

Cute -> POwer

Vulnerable - Prone to attacks -> cute -> influience -> become popular -> thus approachable -> percieved as -> positive -> playful.

"affordances in aesthetic registers"
How the perception of something is categories and the affect (emotional) consequence. 

Thus, add cute register and platform capitalism (e.g. marketing) can scale across relatability, shareability and expression. 

For voices (e.g., Alexa) -> AI helper are default to female
- Humanising computers for branding create approachble power

Large Language Models -> progression in Ai.
- Threat of emotional bonding with AI
- blurring the lines between real and artificial.
