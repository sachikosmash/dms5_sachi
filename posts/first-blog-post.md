# What is cute?

Aesthetic judgements is done through factors that create perception.
Therefore Aesthetic registers is how the perception of something is categorised. For instance, culturem genre and subjective affects (emotions).
The opposite of cute could be zany, chaotic or uncanny.

I found tha aesthetic registers are percieved criteras that aim to distingish perceieved experiences.

## So..... what is cute???

- Approachable
- Non threateniong
- Creates excitemennt - playful
- Sounds fluid, or higher pitches
- Vulnerable

Cute can be powerful. And influence through ideas such as soft power.

Cute -> POwer

Vulnerable - Prone to attacks -> cute -> influience -> become popular -> thus approachable -> percieved as -> positive -> playful.

"affordances in aesthetic registers"
How the perception of something is categories and the affect (emotional) consequence.

Thus, add cute register and platform capitalism (e.g. marketing) can scale across relatability, shareability and expression.

For voices (e.g., Alexa) -> AI helper are default to female

- Humanising computers for branding create approachble power

Large Language Models -> progression in Ai.

- Threat of emotional bonding with AI
- blurring the lines between real and artificial.

## How to make something cute in the context of my design project. Cute and friendly spirits.

- How to make cute visuals: to create a design of approachability, design elements such as sqape and line must be used in a way that is not too prominent a bold. For instance, thick black lines can appear daunting. Therefore, I will remove strokes or shape outlines in my project.

# Creating the Cute

1. How well did you achieve cuteness in the visual, sonic, and interactive domains?

I aimed to achieve cuteness through a consistent and playful aesthetic across visuals, sound, and interaction. Visually, I used soft colour palettes, rounded shapes, and gentle animations to convey a sense of charm and friendliness. In the sonic domain, I incorporated light, whimsical sound effects and upbeat background music to match the playful tone. Interactivity was designed to feel rewarding and joyful, with smooth transitions and delightful microinteractions—like a subtle bounce or sparkle when buttons are clicked. While there's always room for polish, I feel I successfully created a cohesive "cute" experience that invites engagement and makes people smile.

2. What communities and learning resources did you draw on to do the bulk of your learning for this project?

I relied heavily on online communities like Stack Overflow, Reddit, and Dev.to for troubleshooting and advice. I also watched tutorials on YouTube (e.g. The Coding Train and Kevin Powell), and followed some interactive lessons on platforms like FreeCodeCamp and W3Schools for quick refreshers. GitHub was helpful too—seeing how others approached cute UI or gamified interactions gave me a lot of inspiration.

3. What aspects have you enjoyed the most about this process? What have you found to be most surprising?

I really enjoyed the visual design aspect—bringing characters or elements to life with colour and animation was satisfying and fun. It felt like crafting a tiny, interactive world. What surprised me most was how much subtle changes—like easing timing or colour hue—impacted the overall "feel" of the experience. Making something cute isn't just about visuals; it’s about how everything works together to create a mood.

4. What aspects have you struggled with the most? What have you found the most confusing?

The biggest struggle was getting the interactions to feel right—especially making them responsive and smooth across different devices and browsers. I also found it confusing at times to balance cuteness with usability; sometimes overly cute elements risked making the UI less clear. Debugging animations and audio sync issues was another challenge—especially when mixing JavaScript with CSS animations or audio triggers.
